Increased Transparency

The main elements of the forex industry are banks, corporations, traders, investment funds, brokerages and governments. One of the many ways in which blockchain can benefit the industry is by increasing transparency between these players. The distributed ledger is a secure, reliable and immutable way of securing records, be it currency quotes, transactions, laws and regulations or anything else. The FX industry can have its own decentralised record system, which enhances the availability of information.

Contrary to popular belief, the currency markets are not decentralised. Prices are decided and maintained by Central Banks, like the US Federal Reserve or the Bank of England. Small corporations and retail traders are kept out of the loop of this system, which means that they do not have control over how currency prices are decided and maintained. With blockchain, big banks could lose their ability to dictate currency prices and cause significant market moves through their trades. All participants will have equal, convenient and real-time access to price information.
Increased Transaction Speed

We have seen how HSBC has been able to save up on significant transaction costs with blockchain. For years, banks and other financial institutions have been trying to cut down costs related to foreign exchange transactions in a transparent way, the benefits of which, they can pass on to their customers. The World Bank reports that reduction in the cost of cross-border payments alone can save up to $16 billion annually. One of the prominent projects in this area is the Ripple cross-border payment network.

Ripple or XRP is a real-time gross-settlement system remittance network and currency exchange, which facilitates fast payment settlements at minimal costs, to its network of banks and money service businesses. Moreover, the blockchain-based platform allows payments in any currency, including Bitcoin. BLT Group’s Interbit platform, developed in collaboration with Visa, is another example.

Another way in which this system can be put to use is by transitioning the industry into a peer-to-peer lending model. Not just small traders and startups, but big companies or banks can exchange money via the peer-to-peer model, rather than going to the Central Banks for currency reserves. This will be a huge shift from the way the industry operates today, as well as the way the world economy is regulated. The concept of financial intermediaries could be erased.
Increased Security

Blockchain can provide increased security to millions of transaction records and vital personal and banking details. The forex market is known for its high liquidity, which means small amounts of money can be moved, without affecting currency prices. Human error and cybercrime can easily lead to manipulation of trading accounts. Vast sums of money can be siphoned off, leaving legitimate traders to bear the brunt of huge losses.

Blockchain data is cryptographically encoded, through a system known as “hashing.” Information is stored in blocks that have unique hash numbers. The next block in the chain is linked to the previous block through these hash links. This makes the system very difficult to manipulate. Sensitive data is, therefore, harder to hack.
